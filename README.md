This is a microservice which moves (actually just makes links) resources from a "watch list" to another list based on rules.

See [rule.example.json5](rule.example.json5) for an annotated example of a rule.

Rules are located at `/bookmarks/services/ainz/rules` by default (but this can be changed via config).
